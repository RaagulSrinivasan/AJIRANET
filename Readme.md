# Getting Started

## Project Setup

* Download the source code
* In the root folder, execute the command gradle wrapper to resolve gradle version and download dependencies. This will help to skip manual gradle download and setting it as environmental variable.
* Execute gradle build
* To exclude test files, execute gradle build -x test
* Once the build is successful, run the application using #gradle bootRun
* Once the application is up and running, Execute the various test requests available in Testcases.md
